My palindrome checker project is a simple application designed to determine whether a given word is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring any differences in punctuation, case, and spacing.

In my project, users input a word, and the application checks if the word is a palindrome. The application compares the original word with its reverse to determine if they are the same, indicating a palindrome.

Overall, my palindrome checker project provides a practical and educational tool for users to explore and understand the concept of palindromes while demonstrating my programming skills in implementing basic string manipulation and logic.
